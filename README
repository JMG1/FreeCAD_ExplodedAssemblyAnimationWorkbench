Install on linux (other OS should be very similar):

-Go to the .FreeCAD folder in your user directory (/home/username/.FreeCAD), is a hidden folder.
-If it does not exist, create a folder inside called Mod
-Download this repository and extract it inside Mod
-You should have a folder called "FreeCAD_ExplodedAssemblyAnimationWorkbench-master" inside the Mod folder.


Use it:

Create a trajectory:
-Once you have your set of parts place together, switch to the "Exploded Animation" workbench.
-Select the part you want to explode and press the button "Create a new route"
-A pop-up window is displayed asking if you want to create a trajectory from a sketch or from a wire, select sketch.
-Draw the trajectory (don't worry if sketch's placement is not the desired, just draw the trajectory)
-Rotate the sketch using placement tool (sketch properties, placement) if needed

You can also create a trajectory from an existing wire, selecting first the object to animate, second the wire, and "wire"
at the pop-up screen when presing the "Create a new route" icon.

Run the animation:
-Four buttons: Go to start point, run backward, run forward, go to end point
-Animation can't be paused


Have fun.
